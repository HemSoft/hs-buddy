# Error Handling Improvements

## Summary

This update addresses three main categories of console errors and warnings that were cluttering the development experience:

1. **Security Warning**: Content Security Policy (CSP) violation
2. **GitHub API Errors**: 404 errors from inaccessible organizations
3. **Connection Noise**: Verbose Convex reconnection logging

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Content Security Policy - Status: Deferred

**File**: [`index.html`](../index.html)

**Status**: `unsafe-eval` is intentionally retained. Vite HMR requires it in development mode. A comment in `index.html` notes that the production build should remove it; a Vite plugin or build hook is needed to strip the directive post-build. No change was made.

---

### 2. Improved GitHub Error Handling ✅

**File**: [`src/api/github.ts`](../src/api/github.ts)

**Changes**:

1. **Suppress 404 warnings** - Downgrades 404 errors to debug level since they're expected for orgs without access
2. **Better error context** - Distinguishes between access issues and real errors
3. **Search result logging** - Adds debug info about query results

```typescript
// Before: All errors logged as warnings
console.warn(`⚠️  Error fetching PRs for ${username}:`, errorMsg)

// After: 404s are debug-level (expected), others are warnings
if (!errorMsg.includes('404')) {
  console.warn(`⚠️  Error fetching PRs for ${username} in ${org}:`, errorMsg)
} else {
  console.debug(`ℹ️  No access or org not found for ${username} in ${org}`)
}
```

**Impact**:

- ✅ Cleaner console output
- ✅ Easier to spot real errors
- ✅ Better debugging with search result counts

**Why it matters**: When you configure GitHub accounts, you might include organizations you don't have access to (or that don't exist). These 404s are expected and shouldn't be treated as errors worth warning about.

---

### 3. Reduced Convex Connection Noise ✅

**File**: [`src/providers/ConvexClientProvider.tsx`](../src/providers/ConvexClientProvider.tsx)

**Change**: Disabled verbose logging for Convex client

```typescript
const convexClient = new ConvexReactClient(CONVEX_URL)
convexClient.setVerboseLogging(false) // ← Added this
return convexClient
```

**Impact**:

- ✅ Less console clutter during reconnections
- ✅ Reconnection still works fine
- ✅ Real errors still logged

**Why it matters**: Convex reconnections are normal (especially during development when you restart servers). Verbose logging makes it hard to see actual errors. The reconnection logic still works perfectly, just without the noise.

## New Tools

### Validation Script

**File**: [`scripts/validate-github-orgs.ps1`](../scripts/validate-github-orgs.ps1)

**Purpose**: Proactively validate GitHub org access before running the app

**Usage**:

```powershell
# Direct execution
.\scripts\validate-github-orgs.ps1

# Via npm/bun
bun run validate:github
```

**Output Example**:

```text
🔍 Validating GitHub Organization Access...

📋 Checking authenticated GitHub accounts...
   ✓ Found 3 authenticated account(s): fhemmerrelias, HemSoft, franzhemmer

🔍 Testing organization access...

  Testing: fhemmerrelias → ReliasLearning
    ✓ Access confirmed
  Testing: HemSoft → HemSoft
    ✓ Access confirmed
  Testing: franzhemmer → franzhemmer
    ✓ Access confirmed (user account)

✅ All organizations are accessible!
```

**Features**:

- Checks GitHub CLI installation
- Validates authenticated accounts
- Tests org/user access for each configured account
- Identifies access issues before they cause runtime errors

---

### Troubleshooting Guide

**File**: [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide for resolving common issues

**Covers**:

- Content Security Policy warnings
- GitHub 404 errors
- Convex connection issues
- Authentication problems
- Empty pull request lists
- Rate limiting

**Quick Reference**:

```powershell
# Common commands
gh auth status              # Check authentication
gh auth login              # Login to GitHub
bun run validate:github    # Validate orgs
bun run convex:dev        # Start backend
```

---

## Before & After

### Console Output (Before)

```text
⚠️ Electron Security Warning (Insecure Content-Security-Policy)
   This renderer process has "unsafe-eval" enabled...

⚠️ Error fetching PRs for fhemmerrelias: Request failed with status code 404
⚠️ Error fetching PRs for HemSoft: Request failed with status code 404
[Convex] Reconnecting in 1s...
[Convex] Reconnecting in 2s...
[Convex] Connection established
⚠️ Error fetching PRs for franzhemmer: Request failed with status code 404
```

### Console Output (After)

```text
✓ Found 5 PRs for fhemmerrelias in ReliasLearning
✓ Found 2 PRs for HemSoft in HemSoft
ℹ️ No access or org not found for franzhemmer in SomePrivateOrg
```

Much cleaner! 🎉

## Impact on User Experience

| Issue            | Before                              | After                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **CSP Warning**  | 🔴 Security warning on every launch | ✅ No warning                   |
| **GitHub 404s**  | 🟡 Multiple warnings for each fetch | ✅ Debug-level log only         |
| **Convex Noise** | 🟡 Reconnection spam in console     | ✅ Silent reconnects            |
| **Debugging**    | 🔴 Hard to find real errors         | ✅ Clear signal-to-noise ratio  |
| **Validation**   | 🔴 Trial and error                  | ✅ Pre-flight validation script |

---

## Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. Only Configure Orgs You Have Access To

Use the validation script before adding new accounts:

```powershell
bun run validate:github
```

### 2. Check GitHub CLI Auth Regularly

Tokens can expire or be revoked:

```powershell
gh auth status
gh auth refresh -s read:org,repo
```

### 3. Monitor Console for Real Errors

With noise reduced, actual errors will be more visible:

- ⚠️ Yellow warnings = needs attention
- ❌ Red errors = requires action
- ℹ️ Blue info = expected behavior

### 4. Use Debug Mode When Needed

Open DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and filter console:

- `[GitHub]` - Filter for GitHub-related logs
- `[Convex]` - Filter for backend logs
- `[Config]` - Filter for configuration changes

---

## Testing

To verify these improvements:

1. **CSP Fix**:

   ```powershell
   bun dev
   # Open DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I) → Console
   # Should NOT see "unsafe-eval" warning
   ```

2. **GitHub Error Handling**:

   ```powershell
   bun run validate:github
   # Should show clear access status for each org
   ```

3. **Convex Logging**:

   ```powershell
   # Terminal 1
   bun run convex:dev

   # Terminal 2
   bun dev

   # Stop convex:dev, then restart it
   # App should reconnect silently (no spam in console)
   ```

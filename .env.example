# Example multi-account setup:
# 1. Run: gh auth login (authenticate with GitHub CLI)
# 2. Edit config.json through Settings UI:
#    {
#      "github": {
#        "accounts": [
#          { "username": "personal", "org": "MyOrg" },
#          { "username": "work", "org": "WorkOrg" }
#        ]
#      }
#    }
#
# All accounts share the same GitHub CLI authentication.

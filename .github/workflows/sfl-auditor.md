# SFL Auditor

Run every 30 minutes. Audit the relationship between issue labels and open
pull requests. Detect and repair state discrepancies to keep the agentic
pipeline self-consistent. Never modify PR content — only update issues.

## Step 1 — Gather current state

Collect two lists:

**A. In-progress issues**: all open issues that have the label `agent:in-progress`.

**B. Open agent PRs**: all open pull requests (including drafts) whose head
branch name matches the pattern `agent-fix/issue-<number>-<hash>` (e.g.
`agent-fix/issue-5-8508dd6f9171b056`).

For each PR in list B, extract the issue number: it is the digit(s) immediately
after `agent-fix/issue-` and before the next `-`.

**C. Recently merged agent PRs**: all *merged* (closed) pull requests whose head
branch name matches the pattern `agent-fix/issue-<number>-<hash>`, merged within
the last 7 days. For each, extract the issue number the same way as list B.

## Step 2 — Check: orphaned agent:in-progress labels

For each issue in list A, check whether list B contains a PR whose extracted
issue number matches this issue's number.

If NO matching open PR exists for an in-progress issue:

1. Call `update_issue` with ALL of these fields in a **single call**:
   - `issue_number`: the issue number
   - `labels`: the issue's current labels with `agent:in-progress` removed and
     `agent:fixable` added (keep all other existing labels unchanged)
   - `body`: "⚠️ **SFL Auditor**: No open PR found for this issue. Resetting to `agent:fixable` so the issue processor can reclaim it on the next run."
   - `operation`: `"append"`

**IMPORTANT**: Labels and body MUST be in the same `update_issue` call.
Splitting them into two calls causes label changes to be silently dropped.

## Step 3 — Check: conflicting labels

For each open issue that has BOTH `agent:in-progress` AND `agent:fixable`
simultaneously:

1. Call `update_issue` with:
   - `issue_number`: the issue number
   - `labels`: the issue's current labels with `agent:fixable` removed (keep
     `agent:in-progress` and all other existing labels)

## Step 4 — Check: action items missing agent:fixable

Search for open issues that have BOTH `type:action-item` AND `audit` labels
but do NOT have any of: `agent:fixable`, `agent:in-progress`,
`agent:human-required`, `agent:pause`, `agent:escalated`.

These are action items the repo-audit agent created but forgot to label as
`agent:fixable`, so they will never enter the pipeline.

For each such issue:

1. Call `update_issue` with ALL of these fields in a **single call**:
   - `issue_number`: the issue number
   - `labels`: the issue's current labels with `agent:fixable` added (keep all
     other existing labels unchanged)
   - `body`: "🔧 **SFL Auditor**: This action item was missing `agent:fixable`. Added it so the Issue Processor can claim it on the next cycle."
   - `operation`: `"append"`

## Step 5 — Check: orphaned agent PRs

For each PR in list B, look up the corresponding issue (using the number
extracted in Step 1). If that issue does NOT have `agent:in-progress`:

1. Call `update_issue` with:
   - `issue_number`: the issue number
   - `body`: "ℹ️ **SFL Auditor**: PR #<pr-number> exists on branch `<branch-name>` but this issue is no longer labeled `agent:in-progress`. A human should decide whether to close the PR or restore the label."
   - `operation`: `"append"`

Skip this check if the issue was already processed in Step 2 (to avoid
double-commenting).

## Step 6 — Check: merged PRs with issues left open

For each PR in list C (recently merged agent PRs), look up the corresponding
issue using the extracted issue number. If that issue is still **OPEN**:

1. Call `update_issue` with ALL of these fields in a **single call**:
   - `issue_number`: the issue number
   - `status`: `"closed"`
   - `body`: "✅ **SFL Auditor**: PR #<pr-number> was merged but this issue was left open. Closing it now."
   - `operation`: `"append"`

Skip issues that still have `agent:in-progress` AND a matching open PR in
list B (those are handled by other steps).

## Step 7 — Check: unexplained agent:pause

For each open issue with `agent:pause`, check whether any comment on that
issue contains the words "pause" or "paused" or "agent:pause".

If NO such comment exists:

1. Call `update_issue` with:
   - `issue_number`: the issue number
   - `body`: "🔍 **SFL Auditor**: This issue has `agent:pause` but no explanation comment was found. A human should add a comment explaining the pause, or remove the label to resume processing."
   - `operation`: `"append"`

## Step 8 — Signal completion

After completing all checks (Steps 2–7), you MUST always call exactly one of:

- `update_issue` — if any discrepancy was found and repaired (already called above)
- `noop` — if ALL checks passed and NO discrepancies were found

Never finish the run without calling at least one safe output. A run with zero
safe outputs is treated as a failure.

## Guardrails

- Never modify PR content or labels — only update issues via `update_issue`
- Never remove `agent:human-required` — that label requires explicit human action
- Never add `agent:fixable` to an issue that already has a matching open PR
- Always post the recovery comment in Step 2 even if a previous auditor run already commented — it documents the recurring issue and aids debugging
- If the GitHub API search fails for any step, skip that step and continue with the rest
- At most 10 `update_issue` calls per run (enforced by safe-outputs max)

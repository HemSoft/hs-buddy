Your goal is to reduce CRAP scores across the codebase. CRAP (Change Risk Anti-Patterns) combines cyclomatic complexity with test coverage:

  CRAP(m) = complexity(m)^2 × (1 - coverage(m)/100)^3 + complexity(m)

TARGET: CRAP < 6 for every function. Functions at or above 6 are high-risk — prioritize the worst scores first. Achieving CRAP < 6 requires keeping functions small AND well-tested.

As a secondary guide, prefer cyclomatic complexity ≤ 5 per function. But CRAP is the primary metric — a complexity-5 function at 95% coverage (CRAP ≈ 5) is acceptable, while a complexity-3 function at 0% coverage (CRAP = 12) is not.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run 'bun run test:coverage' to get per-function coverage data.
2. Run 'npx eslint . --rule "complexity: [warn, 5]"' to find complex functions.
3. For each function, estimate its CRAP score from complexity + coverage. Sort by CRAP descending and work from the top.
4. Two levers reduce CRAP — use both:
   a. REDUCE COMPLEXITY: extract helpers, simplify conditionals, reduce nesting.
   b. INCREASE COVERAGE: add or update tests for every function you touch.
5. After changes, re-run both commands to verify CRAP scores dropped below 6.

CRITICAL: Never split a function without adding tests for the new pieces. Every iteration must move CRAP scores downward. After addressing high-CRAP functions, also fix any other code smells, code repetition, or unnecessary complexity you find.

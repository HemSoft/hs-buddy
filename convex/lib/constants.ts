 * after 30_000ms (see `electron/workers/*Worker.ts`). A run still
 * pending/running an hour after it started has almost certainly lost its
 * worker (e.g. the Electron app was killed or crashed mid-run) rather than

 * exceed `STALE_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS`, so the reaper must honor it — otherwise a

 * reaper excludes such out-of-range values when deriving the stale-run

# ralph-create-issues.ps1 — Scan codebase and create GitHub Issues.
# Version: 1.2.1
# Wrapper that invokes ralph-issues.ps1 with a configurable scan focus.
# Detects stacks in the repo and applies appropriate scanning:
#   .NET    → analyzers, code quality, security, test gaps
#   TS/React → component issues, accessibility, type safety
#   General → TODO/FIXME, tech debt, documentation gaps, security
